# hello-world

Hello, I'm Ismael but here I go by the name of Oyler which is the correct pronunciation of my favourite Mathematician's name Euler.
I've been programming for quite a while, not saying I'm particularly good at it, but this is the first time I'm using git (properly). 
Although I know a bit of several languages like PHP, JS, C#, Java, Go, C, Python and Lisp, I haven't committed to deeply learn any of these, nevertheless I feel most comfortable with Java, C and Go. 

I'm double majoring Maths and Computer engineering at ITAM in Mexico City, however due to the workload and other issues I've been considering dropping one of these (most probably CE).

The aim of the repositories I'll be making here is to record my progress in several aspects of CE like web dev, data structures, game dev etc. One of my main goals here is to achieve these in several languages. 

I'll do my best to become a better engineer!
